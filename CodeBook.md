#### Summary
This codebook describes what **run_analysis.R** accomplishes as well as the contents of the tidy data file, **tidy_data.txt**, that the script creates.  

#### Description of **run_analysis.R**
**run_analysis.R** is a script written in R to perform the following tasks...

 - Merge the training and the test data sets from this zip file <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip> to create one data set.
    - A Description of the study can be found here <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>
 - Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
    - If the measurement had either the word "mean" or "std" in it, then it was extracted, yielding 86 measurements.  
 - Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set stored in **acitivity_labels.txt**
 - Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names which are stored in **features.txt**.
    - All special characters (i.e. parentheses, commas, and hyphens) were removed from the variable names
 - From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#### Description of **tidy_data.txt**
**tidy_data.txt** contains a 4 x 15480 data frame of tidy data generated by **run_analysis.R**. The raw data was merged and melted based on the principles expressed by Hadley Wickham in his paper “Tidy Data” <http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper>. Given that there are 6 activities, 30 subjects, and 86 measurements, this produces 15480 observations following melting (6 * 30 * 86 = 15480).  Below is a description of the variables in **tidy_data.txt**

 - **subject** – the numeric identifier of each of the participants in the study
 - **activity** – the specific physical activity performed
    - WALKING
    - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    - SITTING
    - STANDING
    - LAYING
 - **measurementVariables** – names of the variables that are the means of the measurement or the standard deviation of the measurement collected in the study.  A full description of these variables can be found in the file named **features_info.txt** which, in turn, can be found in the zipped file here <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>
